Exactly. I would formalize it as an **authoritative simulation plane** plus a separate **intelligence/services plane** connected through gRPC.

The important caveat is that the shared backend should remain **optional and non-authoritative**. A game must still run entirely through scripted policies when that backend—or the model behind it—is unavailable.

```

## The game should call an intelligence gateway, not a particular model

The Orleans/game side should know only about an interface such as:

```csharp
public interface IIntelligenceClient
{
    Task<DecisionResponse> ChoosePlanAsync(
        DecisionRequest request,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}
```

It should not know whether the result came from:

- A 0.8B model on the player’s laptop
- A 2B model on a machine elsewhere on the LAN
- A shared GPU server
- A cloud model
- A deterministic scripted fallback
- A replayed historical decision

The intelligence backend then has provider adapters:

```csharp
public interface IModelProvider
{
    Task<ModelResult> GenerateAsync(
        ModelRequest request,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}

public sealed class LlamaCppProvider : IModelProvider;
public sealed class OllamaProvider : IModelProvider;
public sealed class RemoteModelProvider : IModelProvider;
public sealed class ScriptedProvider : IModelProvider;
```

The gateway-to-model connection does not itself have to use gRPC. For example, the gateway can talk to `llama.cpp` through its native HTTP endpoint while exposing one clean gRPC contract to the rest of the system.

That makes the model runtime replaceable without touching Orleans or the game engine.

## Do not send the complete game state

The game engine should construct a compact, side-specific observation and a bounded set of valid candidate plans.

```protobuf
service IntelligenceService {
  rpc ChoosePlan(DecisionRequest) returns (DecisionResponse);
  rpc GenerateNarrative(NarrativeRequest)
      returns (stream NarrativeChunk);
  rpc GetCapabilities(CapabilitiesRequest)
      returns (CapabilitiesResponse);
}

message DecisionRequest {
  string decision_id = 1;
  string game_id = 2;
  int64 state_version = 3;
  string ruleset_hash = 4;

  CommanderProfile commander = 5;
  StrategicObservation observation = 6;
  repeated PlanCandidate candidates = 7;
}

message PlanCandidate {
  string plan_id = 1;
  string plan_type = 2;

  double objective_score = 3;
  double supply_risk = 4;
  double casualty_risk = 5;
  double expected_value = 6;

  repeated string relevant_facts = 7;
}

message DecisionResponse {
  string decision_id = 1;
  int64 based_on_state_version = 2;
  string selected_plan_id = 3;

  PlanParameters parameters = 4;
  string commander_commentary = 5;
  ModelTrace trace = 6;
}
```

The model should return:

> Select plan `axis_limited_counterattack_03`, retain one armored formation as reserve, and use a higher-than-normal retreat threshold.

It should not return:

> Move counter X through hexes A12, A13, and A14, subtract 37 gallons, roll on table 21.3, and attack at 4:1.

Those operational commands should be generated by the deterministic planner after the plan is selected.

## Keep the gRPC call outside the authoritative grain turn

An Orleans grain can await asynchronous library and remote calls, and Orleans explicitly supports normal `async`/`await`. Blocking synchronous remote I/O inside grain execution is what must be avoided. ([Microsoft Learn][1])

Even so, I would not have `GameGrain` sit and await model inference. Not because async gRPC blocks a .NET thread, but because it couples an authoritative grain turn to a slow and fallible external system.

Use this flow instead:

```text
1. GameGrain reaches a strategic decision barrier.

2. Cna.Core generates:
   - redacted observation
   - valid candidate plans
   - deterministic fallback selection

3. GameGrain persists:
   PendingDecision {
       decisionId,
       stateVersion,
       decisionType,
       expiresAt
   }

4. A DecisionDispatcher calls the intelligence backend.

5. The model returns a proposal.

6. DecisionDispatcher calls:
   GameGrain.SubmitDecisionProposal(...)

7. GameGrain verifies:
   - decision ID matches
   - state version matches
   - plan still exists
   - parameters are within permitted bounds
   - ruleset/configuration hash matches

8. Cna.Core converts the plan into legal commands and events.
```

That lets players continue inspecting the board while the model is working, isolates inference failures, and makes stale model responses harmless.

A response should be rejected whenever:

```text
response.based_on_state_version != game.current_state_version
```

It can then be regenerated or replaced by the scripted fallback.

## What belongs in the shared intelligence layer

### Definitely appropriate

**Model routing**

Choose the model according to decision complexity:

```text
Routine posture choice       → scripted or 0.8B
Normal strategic decision    → 2B
Major campaign decision      → optional 4B
Narrative sentence           → 0.8B
Batch simulation             → scripted only by default
```

**Persona and prompt rendering**

The backend can combine:

- Commander profile
- Side doctrine
- Current strategic posture
- Candidate plans
- Recent significant events
- Output schema

**Structured-output enforcement**

The backend should reject or repair malformed output before returning anything to the game.

**Request deduplication**

Every request gets a durable `decision_id`. A retry with the same ID should return the same stored result rather than generating a second costly answer.

**Model observability**

Record:

- Provider and model
- Quantization
- Prompt-template version
- Persona version
- Latency
- Input/output token counts
- Validation failures
- Fallback reason
- Final response hash

**Optional strategic memory**

The intelligence service can maintain compact advisory memory such as:

```text
The last two central offensives failed because armor outran water supply.
The commander has repeatedly favored mobile defense.
The Allied southern formation appears vulnerable but distant from supply.
```

This memory remains advisory. The event journal remains the actual truth.

**Narrative generation**

Commander remarks, staff briefings, after-action summaries, and replay narration are ideal jobs for this service because mistakes there cannot corrupt game state.

**Evaluation tooling**

The service can compare models against a recorded corpus of decision points:

```text
same observation
same candidate plans
different models/personas
compare selected plan and eventual result
```

That gives you a proper AI benchmark without rerunning full campaigns for every experiment.

## What must stay out of that layer

The intelligence backend should never own:

- Authoritative game state
- Legal-action generation
- Combat calculations
- Pathfinding used to execute orders
- Supply arithmetic
- Random-number generation
- Turn sequencing
- Fog-of-war enforcement
- Victory calculations
- Event persistence
- Rule interpretation at execution time

It may receive a fog-of-war-safe view. It should never have access to the opposing side’s hidden state merely because the server has it.

The game should treat the intelligence backend as an **untrusted strategic adviser**.

## gRPC behavior I would standardize immediately

### Reuse channels

.NET’s gRPC guidance recommends reusing channels because calls can be multiplexed across the existing HTTP/2 connection; creating a fresh channel for every call adds connection setup overhead. ([Microsoft Learn][2])

Register the client once:

```csharp
services.AddGrpcClient<IntelligenceService.IntelligenceServiceClient>(
    options =>
    {
        options.Address = configuration.IntelligenceEndpoint;
    });
```

### Always set deadlines

gRPC calls have no deadline by default, so an inference request can otherwise remain outstanding indefinitely. Deadlines and cancellation should propagate all the way through the gateway to the model provider. ([Microsoft Learn][3])

For example:

```csharp
var response = await client.ChoosePlanAsync(
    request,
    deadline: DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(20),
    cancellationToken: cancellationToken);
```

Decision types can have different budgets:

```text
Routine choice        3–5 seconds
Normal plan choice   10–20 seconds
Major replanning     30–45 seconds
Narrative             5–10 seconds
```

A timeout should produce a scripted decision, not a failed game turn.

### Be careful with retries

Do not blindly retry a generation request because that can perform duplicate inference and produce different decisions.

Retry only when:

- The request includes an idempotent `decision_id`
- The intelligence gateway deduplicates that ID
- No accepted answer has already been recorded
- The game state version is still current

### Use unary calls for decisions

`ChoosePlan` should normally be a unary request/response.

Streaming makes sense for:

- Visible narrative text
- Long after-action reports
- Progress from batch evaluations
- Administrative model download/warmup status

The player does not benefit from seeing a strategic decision token by token. The game needs only the completed structured object.

## The shared backend can support three deployment modes

### Fully local

```text
Desktop application
├── local game runtime or Orleans silo
├── intelligence gateway
└── llama.cpp model process
```

Communication uses localhost, and the game works without internet access.

### Shared LAN model host

```text
Player desktops / game server
             │
             ▼
Intelligence gateway on GPU machine
             │
             ▼
Shared local model
```

This would let multiple games share one stronger machine without embedding model runtimes in every client.

### Hosted deployment

```text
Orleans cluster
      │
Decision workers
      │
Intelligence gateway replicas
      │
Model workers / external providers
```

The same protobuf contract works in all three modes.

## “Other backend stuff” should be divided into modules

I would avoid turning the intelligence gateway into a general dumping ground. Think in terms of three service areas:

### Intelligence services

- Plan selection
- Persona handling
- Narrative generation
- Memory/RAG
- Model routing
- Evaluation

### Platform services

- Accounts and identity
- Multiplayer lobbies
- Invitations
- Matchmaking
- Cloud saves
- Notifications
- Scenario/mod distribution

### Compute services

- Batch simulations
- Bot tournaments
- Model-versus-model evaluations
- Scenario balance analysis
- Replay report generation

These can begin as one **modular ASP.NET Core backend** while retaining explicit internal boundaries:

```text
Cna.Backend
├── Intelligence
├── Platform
├── SimulationJobs
├── Content
└── Observability
```

You do not need five separately deployed microservices initially. Split them only when their scaling or deployment requirements actually diverge.

The model process probably should remain a separate process from the start because it has very different memory, lifecycle, and hardware requirements.

## I would expose different protocols in different directions

```text
Browser / desktop UI
    → HTTPS + SignalR/WebSocket
    → Game/API host

Game host / decision workers
    → gRPC
    → Intelligence backend

Intelligence backend
    → provider-specific HTTP/native protocol
    → llama.cpp, Ollama, MLX, or hosted model
```

ASP.NET Core can expose gRPC-Web or JSON-transcoded gRPC endpoints when browser compatibility is necessary, but there is little reason for the browser to call the intelligence service directly. Keeping that traffic behind the game API preserves authorization, fog of war, and decision validation. ([Microsoft Learn][4])

## The practical initial version

I would start with:

```text
Cna.Core
    pure deterministic game and planners

Cna.OrleansHost
    authoritative games

Cna.DecisionWorker
    receives pending decisions and invokes intelligence

Cna.Intelligence.Contracts
    protobuf definitions

Cna.Intelligence.Gateway
    ASP.NET Core gRPC service

llama.cpp
    separate local model process
```

And provide two implementations:

```csharp
public interface IIntelligenceClient
{
    Task<DecisionResponse> ChoosePlanAsync(...);
}

public sealed class GrpcIntelligenceClient : IIntelligenceClient;
public sealed class ScriptedIntelligenceClient : IIntelligenceClient;
```

The scripted implementation is not merely an emergency hack. It is:

- The default for headless simulation
- The deterministic test baseline
- The fallback for timeouts
- The comparison point for model evaluations
- The mode used when a player disables AI services

So yes: **gRPC to a shared backend is exactly the right direction**, provided the shared backend selects and explains strategy rather than owning or resolving the game. The cleanest description is:

> Orleans hosts authoritative campaigns. The deterministic core resolves the game. A gRPC intelligence gateway provides optional strategic judgment, persona, narration, memory, and model abstraction. Every response returns as a versioned proposal that the game validates before execution.

## Rules fidelity and incremental delivery

Sandtable targets a faithful digital implementation of the original 1979 SPI game rather than a
generic campaign engine. The proposed initial authority is the original rules and component data
as corrected by the September 1979 errata. Community rulebooks, trackers, and digital modules are
comparison aids, not authority.

The first delivery path follows the game's published modular structure:

```text
rules laboratory
    -> replayable Land movement/contact/combat skeleton
    -> Land-only Graziani's Offensive scenario
    -> detailed Air Game
    -> detailed Logistics Game
    -> later scenarios and full campaign
```

Authoritative rules, tables, scenario data, and adopted rulings carry stable source references and
participate in the ruleset hash. Commands produce events; events rebuild campaign state; snapshots
are replay checkpoints. Unsupported mechanics fail explicitly rather than falling through to a
plausible approximation.

The physical game's hierarchical sequence must remain visible in the model. A weekly Game Turn
contains Operation Stages, player phases, and repeatable movement/combat segments. The engine
therefore uses versioned phase/segment identifiers instead of a monolithic `AdvanceTurn` operation.

The initial `Cna.Core` implementation makes that boundary executable. `Cna.Core.Rules` defines
source-cited normalized artifacts, complete adopted-ruling metadata, a canonical `cna-1979.1`
manifest derived from the Land sequence catalog, and the Land-only sequence-outline hierarchy from
the original rules. Operation Stage actor order follows the source rule, including the reversed
initiative-holder order in Stage 2. `Cna.Core.Campaigns` uses pure command decisions and immutable
events to create a campaign only against that canonical manifest. It validates caller-supplied
snapshots before adjudication and rejects progression at Initiative Determination because the
mandatory rule has not yet been implemented; inspecting later catalog positions is explicitly a
non-authoritative rehearsal, not an event-producing shortcut. A projector rejects inconsistent
trusted history, while canonical snapshot serialization and a replay harness prove reconstruction
of accepted campaign history. These events have no ambient timestamps or generated IDs, and no
random draw is modeled before a real rule consumes one; the recorded seed is reserved for that
first seeded mechanic.

The current projector is a trusted-history contract, not an untrusted ingestion boundary. Before
Chronicle events can arrive from persistence, transport, or another process, that boundary must
authenticate and validate event provenance and add a positive contiguous-advance replay contract
for the first implemented mechanic.

Copyrighted source scans and original component art remain outside the repository unless explicit
permission is recorded. Sandtable uses normalized, provenance-bearing rule data and original
visuals. See the [source-material spike](docs/research/cna-source-material-spike.md) and
[pre-alpha roadmap](docs/roadmap/pre-alpha-roadmap.md) for evidence, scope, and decision gates.
